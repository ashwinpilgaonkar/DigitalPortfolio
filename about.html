            My interests lie in the fields of <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong> and <strong>Android app Development</strong>.<br>
            I am expecting to complete my undergraduate degree from <strong>NIIT University</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.<br>
            I'm currently pursuing the <strong>Android Developer Nanodegree</strong> from <strong>Udacity</strong><br> and have published an app to <strong>Google Play Store.</strong>
