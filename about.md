<p>Hi, I'm a Computer Science undergrad from Goa, India.
Hey, Iâ€™m an independent web & software developer from Dublin, Ireland. I work primarily with Ember.js and Django.
Have a look through some of my projects and blog posts. Need help with an upcoming project or application? Learn a bit more about me and then consider hiring me.</p>

<p>I am very passionate about music. I have been playing the Piano since 2003 and can play most songs by ear. I have learnt classical piano as well (mostly self taught).
I started learning fingerstyle guitar in 2016 during my free time. If you would like to hear me play, check out my SoundCloud.</p>
